# Labratory report : Software Technology Experiment Assignment 1

[Web app: Infinite forest](https://infinite-forest-78427.herokuapp.com/)

## Technial problems (installation of software)
I encountered some problems with Java and Maven considering path etc. however there was nothing big, just setting some *Environment Variables* such as 
* **%JAVA_HOME%**  
* **%MAVEN_HOME%** 

After that things went smooth, the totorial was fairly bulletproof. (It was easier to fix on MAC OS :P)


## Validation of software
I validated the software by scaling and testing it in the browser. By using commands such as `heroku ps:scale `. I also used Heroku product check

## Technial problems (Heroku platform)
The only issue i encountered on Heroku was the validation by credit card, something im not super eager to do, other than that it went smooth as butter.

## Pending issues
No pending issues.
