# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 3
## Experiment 1: MongoDB CRUD operations
### Technical issues:
During this tutorial I did not encouter any problems. Setting path etc for `mongosh` was easy considering we had to do the same for `Maven`.

### Correct installation
I created a PowerShell script called `checkSignatures.ps1` and ran it
I was able to get retrive the `SHA256` hash computed from the MongoDB binary i downloaded and compared it to the `SHA256` hash i downloaded directly from MongoDB and they were a match.
